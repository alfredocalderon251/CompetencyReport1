        Monster Hunter: World is an action role-playing game developed and published by Capcom. A part of the Monster Hunter series, it was released worldwide for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in January 2018, with a Microsoft Windows version in August 2018. In the game, the player takes the role of a Hunter, tasked to hunt down and either kill or trap monsters that roam in one of several environmental spaces. If successful, the player is rewarded through loot consisting of parts from the monster and other elements that are used to craft weapons and armor, amongst other equipment. The game's core loop has the player crafting appropriate gear to be able to hunt down more difficult monsters, which in turn provide parts that lead to more powerful gear. Players may hunt alone, or can hunt in cooperative groups of up to four players via the game's online services.

        Ragnarok Online is a MMOG RPG set in the fictional land of Midgard. Although there is a background story, the game is open-ended. Players can choose from a variety of job classes. A typical activity on Ragnarok Online would be leveling characters and finding powerful equipment and items. These can be used to fight monster bosses or in one on one combat with other players. A big feature of this game is the War of Emperium, in which different factions, or guilds, can battle for and take castles. These castles give access to dungeons and treasures only available to the residing guild. Ragnarok Online has a vibrant economy as well. This economy is based on buying and selling regular and rare items dropped by monsters through the use of Zeny, the Midgard currency. Ragnarok Online offers anime-style 2D characters on 3D backdrops
